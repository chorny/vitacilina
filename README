NAME
    Vitacilina - ¡Ah, qué buena medicina!

DESCRIPTION
    A simple feeds engine exporter that uses YAML to get list of feeds and
    TT as templating system. Some people would call it an aggregator. At
    first, it was intended to be a reliable Planet
    (<http://planetplanet.org>) alternative.

SYNOPSIS
     use Vitacilina;

     my $v = Vitacilina->new(
       config => 'config.yaml',
       template => 'template.tt',
       output => 'output.html',
       limit => '20',
     );

     $v->render;

FILES
  config
    The "config" parameter specifies the path to a YAML file specifying a
    list of feeds. Use this format:

     http://myserver.com/myfeed:
       name: Some Cool Feed

  template
    A "Template::Toolkit" file which will be taken as the template for
    output. Format:

     [% FOREACH p IN data %]
      <a href="[% p.permalink %]">[% p.title %]</a>
       by <a href="[% p.channelUrl %]">[% p.author %]</a>
      <br />
     [% END %]

    The "data" is an ordered array with a bunch of hashes with the simple
    data such as "permalink", "title", "channelUrl", "author", etc.

  output
    File path where the output will be written.
