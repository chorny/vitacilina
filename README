NAME
    Vitacilina - ¡Ah, qué buena medicina!

DESCRIPTION
    A simple feeds engine exporter that uses YAML to get list of feeds and
    TT as templating system. Some people would call it an aggregator. At
    first, it was intended to be a reliable Planet
    (<http://planetplanet.org>) alternative.

             output => 'output.html',
             limit => '20',
     );

     $v->render;
